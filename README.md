## Configuration

The following source configuration file will sync to a PostgreSQL database. See [the CloudQuery Quickstart](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/quickstart) for more information on how to configure the source and destination.

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "poozle"
  path: "poozlehq/poozle"
  version: "${VERSION}"
  destinations:
    - "postgresql"
  spec:
    # plugin spec section
```

## Development

### Run tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run linter

```bash
make lint
```

### Generate docs

```bash
make gen-docs
```

### Release a new version

1. Run `git tag v1.0.0` to create a new tag for the release (replace `v1.0.0` with the new version number)
2. Run `git push origin v1.0.0` to push the tag to GitHub

Once the tag is pushed, a new GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered to build the release binaries and create the new release on GitHub.
To customize the release notes, see the Go releaser [changelog configuration docs](https://goreleaser.com/customization/changelog/#changelog).
